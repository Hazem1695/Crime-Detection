# Crime-Detection 
To Detect Crime From Videos

Crime is spread fast in the whole world, and I think idea of this project to detect crime from surveillance cameras can make world is safe place and this project will save time and effort that traditional method takes to detect crime from surveillance cameras or videos and will avoid human error. So, I built an AI Model to detect crime from videos using computer vision, Transformer and deep learning algorithms to analyze real-time video streams from surveillance cameras and detect any crime. and this model can work in real-time.

Test accuracy of my model is 66.67 

Accuracy can improve by train on larger dataset i train on 240 videos and i test on 60 videos split it to Normal and Abnormal

Code that I follow: https://keras.io/examples/vision/video_transformers/

Dataset I used: 

Dataset1: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minhajuddinmeraj/anomalydetectiondatasetucf

Dataset2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webadvisor/real-time-anomaly-detection-in-cctv-surveillance

Note: 

1- Make sure TensorFlow version is 2.15.0

2- Make sure Keras version is 3
